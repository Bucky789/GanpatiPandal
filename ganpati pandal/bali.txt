Goa Gajah, or Elephant Cave, is located on the island of Bali near Ubud, in Indonesia. Built in the 9th century, it served as a sanctuary

History:-
 Although the exact origins of the cave are uncertain, it is believed to have been built as place for spiritual meditation.
One folklore relates that it was created by the fingernail of the legendary giant Kebo Iwa. However, examining its style, 
the sanctuary was probably dated from the 11th century Bali Kingdom. The complex contains both Hindu and Buddhist imagery, as the cave contains lingam and yoni,
 symbol of Shiva, and the image of Ganesha, while by the river there are carved images of stupas and chattra, imagery of Buddhism.
The cave was rediscovered by Dutch archaeologists in 1923, but the fountains and bathing pool were not discovered until 1954.

World Heritage Status:- 

This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on October 19, 1995, in the Cultural category,
 but was pulled out along with 11 other sites on 2015.
