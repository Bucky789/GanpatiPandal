The season of revering Lord Ganesha was here once again and large parts of India had been celebrating the arrival of the elephant God in their homes in full swing.
 Ganesha is one of the most popular Gods among Hindus, and several mythologists are of the opinion that unlike many other Gods of the Hindu pantheon, 
Ganesha’s uniqueness lies in the fact that reverence for him spreads across all castes. 
An interesting aspect of Ganpati’s popularity, however, is that he is one of the few Hindu Gods whose strong presence can be felt outside India as well, 
particularly in the countries neighbouring India such as Tibet, China, Japan and many others in Southeast Asia.
