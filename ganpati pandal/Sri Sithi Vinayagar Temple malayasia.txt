Petaling Jaya. It is run by the Petaling Jaya Hindu Association.

The history of the Sri Sithi Vinayagar Temple dates back to the early 1950s when Petaling Jaya was established as a residential suburb to ease over-population of
 fast growing Kuala Lumpur. The new township attracted many residents and soon the Hindu population of Petaling Jaya increased dramatically.
 At this stage, the pioneer Hindu residents felt the great need for their own place of worship. This temple was one of the first Vinayagar Temple in Malaysia
